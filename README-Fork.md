# Changes
- Added 2 files, [listing.py](listing.py) for listing all files in a volume and [recovery.py](recovery.py) for recovering all files in a volume

# Attention
- Use sudo to run the script
- All permissions of files recovered using [recovery.py](recovery.py) are set to 777
- [A pr](https://github.com/jivanpal/drat/pull/25) in the original repository will add a command dumpfiles to restore files, so this will be outdated when that changes are merged
